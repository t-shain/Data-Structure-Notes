## Review

##### Pointers
>- template keyword creates a variable type that can be changed
>- using an (*) stores a reference.
>- Dereferencing the pointer allows you to go to where the pointer is pointing and user the methods it has access to.
>>- this is done by using the (->) operator.

##### Stacks
>- like building blocks
>- you can only add to the top.
>- you can only remove from the top.
>- Stacks should use nodes the reference each other from the top down. so when you take out a node from the top you know the reference of the the next node quickly.
