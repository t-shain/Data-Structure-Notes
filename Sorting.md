# Sorting algos

#### Stability 
>- when there are duplicate values, they stay in the same relative order before and after sorting.
>- You have to sort in reverse order of the attributes that you want to sort by, in that the first atribute you sort by is the last attribute or "tie breaker".

#### Heap sorting
>- uses a heap tree to sort a vector. It does this by deleting the root node then resorting the heap until there are zero nodes left in the heap.
