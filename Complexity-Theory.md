# Complexity Theory
>* Big idea: we want an idea to determine how much time and or memory is used by an algorithm as the amount of input data grows. <br>
>* We want to compare similar solutions to determine what works the best. 
#### Big[o] notation
>* Big-Oh T(N) = O(f(N))as long as your data is big enough your algorithm will take as least as much time as f(N) times some c multiplier, or take less time and be better!.
>>* **Translation of Big-Oh** As the input size grows, how much longer will the algorithm take to run?
>* Big-Omega is a lower bound saying that your algo is never getting as good as this.
