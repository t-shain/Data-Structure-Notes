## Priority Queues and Binary Heaps
>* we want to be able to insert a node
>* we want to remove the highest priority node.
>* like a sports standings list where things are in a queue but are based off a priority.
#### Binary heaps
>* The BH lets you make a priority queue
>* BH is a binary tree where all the gens are optimized to be as filled as possible then the bottom most gen gets filled from left to right.
>* These filled binary trees can be stored in an array/ vector
